## Description
The goal is to implement a service that allows users to subscribe and unsubscribe from notifications, newsletters, or other services. This service should handle user actions and maintain their subscription status.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** a user is logged in,  
**When** the user subscribes to a service,  
**Then** the user's subscription status is updated to "subscribed".

**Given** a user is logged in,  
**When** the user unsubscribes from a service,  
**Then** the user's subscription status is updated to "unsubscribed".

**Given** a user subscribes,  
**When** the subscription action is successful,  
**Then** a confirmation notification is sent to the user.

**Given** a user unsubscribes,  
**When** the unsubscription action is successful,  
**Then** a confirmation notification is sent to the user.

## Assumptions:
- The user has already been authenticated in the system.
- The service will use a database to store user subscription statuses.
- The service will be integrated with an email/SMS notification system to notify users on subscription changes.

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure proper validation for user input (e.g., preventing a user from subscribing multiple times without unsubscribing).
- Consider scalability for handling large numbers of users.

## Estimated Time: 5 hours
